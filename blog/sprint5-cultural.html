        <h3>What are three things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I need to have more confidence when undertaking new learning as I have struggled to solve problems in a way which is quite alien like flipped learning, and do less seconding guessing myself.
            See setbacks or failure as ok and a really bad day is acceptable, and see it as a new opportunity to grow, learn and stop being hard on myself and say the mantra not yet.<br>
            I have been on the emotional roller coaster ride of feeling I'm not good enough, or I'm stupid and just don't have the right skills. However, in life there is the ultimate question the what if scenario. So, just give it your best shot that is all anyone can do in life. Small wins can be repeated over time which can encourage a growth mindset.
        </p>
            
            
        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self – awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
            The role of values can be a way to gauge for how you deal with other people in a team and set a standard for learning to achieve goals or reach aspirations. Empathy is about when things are going wrong and when things are ok, but for learning and programming it is about being aware of how you interact with others and judging their feelings as to assist in a positive manner.<br>
            Empathy can utilise the ability to sense other people’s feelings and self-awareness as to how you respond when sharing a task or responding to other people within that group. It helps us perceive how our values can help or hinder progress, or how we deal with sensitive situations working in a team by identifying other cultures and values. 
            
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            It really is a roller coaster ride of ups and downs from week two onwards, and you think that your prepared but that is far from the truth. <br>There are days when your confidence is ok but then moments that just simply go belly up and disappointment, and then you question the growth mindset theory that it is ok to fail or remove a negative voice which crops up and sits on your shoulder like a parrot. I have felt stupid, silly, and frustrated by a lack of progress and cried. My problem-solving skills are not what I thought, and I still struggle with this aspect of flipped learning and misunderstood the tasks.
        </p>
            
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            The flipped approach which Dev Academy uses has been a battle for a large portion of core learning. A large dose of determination for the technical challenges was like facing Mount Everest.<br>Second and hardest challenge was and is trying to adapt to a growth mindset. I found connecting the dots hard and still cannot say that the core learning material is fully understood, as at times I use the term information overload and a jigsaw with some bits not put in place for a complete picture of five sprints.<br>Getting the technical challenges done on time were a bit hit and miss with the time boxing and trying with the best will in the world to determine what was being asked of me was and is hard.
        </p>
            
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
            It is stated that three things are needed to code such as utilising problem-solving techniques or tools, a planned approach and understanding problems. The first five weeks shape those qualities which stand out as a must for programming and serve people well for employers.<br> A growth mindset is a good way to see failure as positive and the chance to learn so that you can succeed with hard work, and a whole heap of perseverance.
        </p>
            
            
        <h3>Does the time spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
            I guess the core material acts as a useful tool to cover the framework of web development. It allows an insight into key aspects or enlighten people as to what is expected from both a technical and non-technical perspective. Core learning compliments soft skills with the difficulty of coding.
