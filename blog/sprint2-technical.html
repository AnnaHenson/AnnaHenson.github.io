<p>I found id and classes confusing or like a jungle. So, I went with id and classes for HTML.</p>

<h3>HTML code is the builder or skeleton while CSS is the artist for a web site. </h3>
<p>An id attribute targets an HTML element, so it is unique but cannot be shared within a HTML document. <br>For example, a header element is defined by an id, so a h1 element in a header is styled and defined in the head section. Note you need the # then an id name so an element is styled in a style declaration by using the CSS style sheet.</p>

<ul>
    <li>You cannot have more than one element with the same id in the HTML document.</li>
<li>An Element id points to an element for styling on a web page in CSS.</li>
<li>HTML elements can belong to more than class.</li>
<li>An apply one element per class or multiple elements on one class.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion a class can be used on any HTML element and have specific names for elements whilst enabling CSS to get at specific elements for the glamorous appearance to users. </p>
<p>HTML is the tree whilst the leaves and blossom make it look pretty using CSS.</p>
