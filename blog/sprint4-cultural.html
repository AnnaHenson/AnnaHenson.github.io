        <h2>Sprint 4 Neuroplasticity    22/02/2021</h2>
        
        
<h3><emp>How the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</emp></h3>
<p>The first principle is that our brains can learn new information and is not compartmentalised into what we can and cannot do, secondly, neuroplasticity can connect the dots more efficiently for building stronger or more efficient connecting pathways.<br> It can take away the feeling of not being as smart as other people and utilise the capability to grow, also enhance human capability through diversity or building the connecting dots for self-confidence to learn and flourish.</p>

<h3><emp>How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity (own benefit)</emp></h3>
<p>I do not regard myself as a natural at being analytical or doing abstraction but will do trail, and error most of the time along with curiosity.<br> The way I am going to engage is embrace the mantra it takes effort, and using neuroplasticity is part of my whole being. Secondly, I might not be Einstein but with practice, and more practice along with effort I will emphasize the point “I am just not there ” and believe abilities can be developed. 

<h3><emp>What are some of the ways to increase individual neuroplasticity?</emp></h3>
<p>Use dynamic interactions with the learning environment as to utilise the different disciplinary ways of valuing creativity and review any impacts, or values which we notice of and take the risk so that errors benefit the chance to review and learn.<br>I think of the quote from JW “We think of the mind as a warehouse to be filled when we should be thinking of it as a tool to be used”.
<p>Experiencing new opportunities to learn are ok for a growth mindset and making discoveries that build neurons or pathways to help the brain become more malleable. Take the logic that mistakes happen but you learn and reflect then go again so building up knowledge can be learnt as it is ongoing.</p>

Ted Talks.com:Bring on the learning revolution which highlighted embedded academic intelligence results, which I get as I did a vocational route, but schools wanted academic results to identify university entrants.</


<h3><strong>Growth Mindset</strong></h3>


<h3><emp>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</emp></h3>
<p>You need to be able to grow as we are all unique and have abilities which can get us to where we envisage the finish line. A growth mind removes the notion I am not smart by replacing it with celebrating diversity. <br>This is by effort, good teaching and persistence so you can celebrate success.

<p><strong>Rogers </strong>(1996) 4 categories Presentation, participatory, discovery and evaluation. Learning is not static and an experience which may involve a change in a person with a growth mindset and an openness to the learning experience.</p>
<p>I have spent some time in the fixed mind camp regarding technology, and now I have had moments of a growth mindset making tiny steps.  It highlights my confidence can grow but it may will take longer than others with persistence, practice and more practice to get better, therefore a growth mindset is ongoing not static.</p>

<h3><emp>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</emp></h3>
<p>I will make sure that my mind is open and try to avoid the fixed mind set, whilst believing that over time practice will make learning easier.</p>
