    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    
           
<h3>What was the problem?</h3>

<p><strong>The problem was:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Each property has a value assigned to a new object.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I created a variable with an empty object and defined gradebook, but then forgot a property should be assigned to the value of a new object.<br> So, the property Elizabeth was not being assigned to an empty object, which meant the property value was not recognised in the code. The computer could not read the property of Elizabeth so was shown as undefined, which came up as an error on the console on the right.

<h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
<p>
    My first option was to try some pseudocode code and write down the steps in English to utilise a reasoning tool, but it did not go to plan. The other technique was to try and read the error messages in relation to errors for code failure, but my final throw of the dice was to ask both a developer and facilitator what the hell was wrong.
</p> 
<h3>You can choose:</h3>
    <ul>
	    <li>Pseudocode</li>
	    <li>Try something!</li>
	    <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
	    <li>Reading error messages</li>
	    <li>Console. Logging</li>
	    <li>Googling</li>
	    <li>Asking peers for help</li>
	    <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
	    <li>Improving your process for reflection</li>
    </ul>

<h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
<p>
    I thought it seemed easy at the very beginning of the task but then seemed to get complicated for me, so frustration crept in and the clock was ticking. I felt the fight or flight mode and could not see the wood for the trees. <img src="/images/sadness.png"  style="margin-left: 5px;"/>

<h3>How did you learn?</h3>
<p>
    Analytical solving problem is not my forte, well if its green or connected with horticulture then yeh I can solve the problem or problems. At this moment in time for coding I am just trying to solve the damn problem.

<h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem-solving techniques and processes.</h3>
<p>
    I think a pseudocode approach has been my first port of call to go through the problem, so I am trying to write down the steps and chunk up more the task. <br>Another option is to start and read the error messages to try and diagnose the issue, and then reflect that against the code for clues.
    Due to dyslexia, it is the way information is written down that makes a task doable, if not flight mode creeps in. My biggest and most difficult hurdle is what do they want from me. I am trying to chunk things up and showing solutions help to make a start. Reflection is useful but comprehension of a task still confusing at times.
