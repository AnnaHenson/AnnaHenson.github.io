        <h2>Sprint 2 My Learning Plan    13/02/2021</h2>
<h3>The Long-term goal/or career pathway.</h3>
<p>My goal is to combine my horticulture experience plus technology to develop digital awareness for school environmental projects.</p>

<h3>Human skills I would like to develop while at EDA.</h3>
<p>Be able to discuss a topic which is so outside my comfort zone without feeling embarrassed and then trying to clarify information back to others, which being dyslexic can get confused with what is in my head. Probably need to improve a few habits to boost confidence and focus as not get lost in the forest, whilst ensuring more clarity, and reducing the confusion to fit the pieces of the puzzle.</p>

<h3>My strengths and limitations.</h3>
<p>My strengths are trying to do my best and do a good job, whilst finishing all the tasks to schedule as planned with respect and integrity. I always try to complete work as to learn new skills which move you forwards with a sense of purpose, and if I feel confident will plough ahead with perseverance. However, my limitations of self-criticism, frustration regarding progress has reared its head. I guess my expectations of the brain were underestimated and avoiding burnout is constantly there in my head. Secondly, it is easy to get lost down a rabbit hole and be overwhelmed which I can at times forget, and not having time to review material at the weekend with less stress. Stress is being added as I am dealing with lower back pain, so it is a challenge keeping to my schedule.</p>

<h3>How and where you will seek help in a timely manner.</h3>
<p>I will try to ask other people whether it is the developer community or asking the facilitator on slack for suggestions to review sources on websites for a task. The other option will be to ask those on the course for help to finish tasks and try to ask the right questions effectively with less confusion in my head.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Seek help ahead or in advance of deadlines.</li>
	<li>Try to be more focused and manage of block-out times when communicating with people.</li>
	<li>Communicate more clearly if needed ahead of weekly facilitator meetup.</li>
	<li>Be respectful, honest and courteous when communicating with others.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Expectations from Dev Academy facilitation team.</h3>
<p>I expect the facilitation team to appreciate the impact of dyslexia. Also, the ability to have contact weekly by verbal communication plus using slack to send messages when stuck or blocked as a first point of call. The final expectation is to discuss feedback to highlight any areas of concern with suggestions or pointers, especially when a weekly catch up is scheduled with the facilitator.</p>

<h3>Block-out times</h3>
<p>I will need to have time to deal with some a health issue to help alleviate a back problem, which affects my sleep pattern and can cause inflammation for discomfort when sitting down. This includes block-out times for lunch breaks to do what is necessary as prescribed by health professionals.</p>
