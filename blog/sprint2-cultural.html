        <h2>Sprint 2 My Learning Plan    13/02/2021</h2>
<h3>The Long-term goal/or career pathway.</h3>
<p>My goal is to combine my horticulture experience plus technology to develop digital awareness for school environmental projects.</p>

<h3>Human skills I would like to develop while at EDA.</h3>
<p>Be able to discuss a topic which is so outside my comfort zone without feeling embarrassed and then trying to clarify information back to others, which being dyslexic can get confused with what is in my head. Probably need to improve a few habits to boost confidence and focus as not get lost in the forest, whilst ensuring more clarity, and reducing the confusion to fit the pieces of the puzzle.</p>

<h3>My strengths and limitations.</h3>
<p>My strengths are trying to do my best and do a good job, whilst finishing all the tasks to schedule as planned with respect and integrity. I always try to complete work as to learn new skills which move you forwards with a sense of purpose, and if I feel confident will plough ahead with perseverance. However, my limitations of self-criticism, frustration regarding progress has reared its head. I guess my expectations of the brain were underestimated and avoiding burnout is constantly there in my head. Secondly, it is easy to get lost down a rabbit hole and be overwhelmed which I can at times forget, and not having time to review material at the weekend with less stress. Stress is being added as I am dealing with lower back pain, so it is a challenge keeping to my schedule.</p>

<h3>How and where you will seek help in a timely manner.</h3>
<p>I will try to ask other people whether it is the developer community or asking the facilitator on slack for suggestions to review sources on websites for a task. The other option will be to ask those on the course for help to finish tasks and try to ask the right questions effectively with less confusion in my head.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Seek help ahead or in advance of deadlines.</li>
	<li>Try to be more focused and manage block-out times when communicating with people.</li>
	<li>Communicate more clearly if needed ahead of weekly facilitator meetup.</li>
	<li>Be respectful, honest and courteous when communicating with others.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Expectations from Dev Academy facilitation team.</h3>
<p>I expect the facilitation team to appreciate the impact of dyslexia. Also, the ability to have contact weekly by verbal communication plus using slack to send messages when stuck or blocked as a first point of call. The final expectation is to discuss feedback to highlight any areas of concern with suggestions or pointers, especially when a weekly catch up is scheduled with the facilitator.</p>

<h3>Block-out times</h3>
<p>I will need to have time to deal with some a health issue to help alleviate a back problem, which affects my sleep pattern and can cause inflammation for discomfort when sitting down. This includes block-out times for lunch breaks to do what is necessary as prescribed by health professionals.</p>

<h2>Learning plan for Bootcamp</h2>

<h3>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
<p>
    Develop technology that emphasises awareness of horticulture. This would combine my skills in horticulture over the years and allow technology to promote New Zealand flora.
</p>

<h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be on Bootcamp?</h3>
<p>
    I think one of my biggest strengths is establishing a rapport with new people who I have not met before, I have done this within customer service. I seem to be able to connect with people and like to build connections for collaboration.<br> Another strength will be sensing when another person wants to share ideas for progress, whilst knowing when they need space to think or just actively listen and build empathy.
</p>
<ol>Limitations are:
	<li><emp>Still need more self-confidence on a crap day.</emp></li>
	<li><emp>Face failure as an opportunity not as a disappointment.</emp></li>
    <li><emp>The final limitation is overcoming what the hell I am being asked to do and feeling stupid followed by negativity.</emp></li>
</ol>

<h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
<p>
    The challenge will be not to burn myself out as being dyslexic means a lot more effort for the same result, whilst making sure the brain does not get so tired that I cannot concentrate or constantly feel tired, which is a real challenge for me.<br>
    Reducing anxiety to just keep up with the work which again is a personal challenge due to the way the brain works, so, I do not feel I am letting anyone down, or preventing progress for other people.
</p>


<h3>What non-technical skills -human-skills would you like to see developed while at EDA?</h3>
<p>
    I think the skills mentioned below are the most critical otherwise the phrase fight or flight will appear, and flight is human nature as a reaction to feeling threatened.
</p>
<ol>
	<li><emp>Reduce self-criticism and improve wellbeing.</emp></li>
	<li><emp>Keep going in the growth mindset direction or remember not yet approach.</emp></li>
	<li><emp>Do not worry about mistakes or looking silly when I cannot describe something that is new.</emp></li>
</ol>



<h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
<p>
    Just to be accessible when things are getting on top of me or I am feeling overwhelmed, and I can feel my wellbeing is affected or affecting those around me.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Develop useful lifelong human skills.</li>
	<li>Enable progression within the subject. </li>
	<li>Talk through understanding a problem one to one.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
<p><strong>
    To try and reach the end goal without making myself ill and enjoy bootcamp rather than worrying or getting upset most of the time.
</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Seek advice in a timely manner through facilitators.</li>
	<li>Seek help from peers at bootcamp and human skills staff.</li>
	<li>Communication with team members.</li>
</ol>
<p><emp>My commitment:</emp></p>
<ol>
	<li>Learn and develop skills over time and try to encourage a growth mindset.</li>
	<li>Try to seek advice ahead of deadlines by communicating with others.</li>
</ol>
