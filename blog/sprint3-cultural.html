        <h2>Sprint 3 EQ verses IQ    15/02/2021</h2>
        
        <h3><emp>EQ and IQ.</h3></emp>
        <p>IQ stands for intelligent quotient using standardised tests to assess scores and ranks ability against using quantitative data to rank academic ability. Some believe IQ is innate and reflects your intellectual abilities for learning.</p> 
        <p><strong>Abilities:</strong>To understand, apply information, logical reasoning, word comprehension, math skill, abstract and spatial awareness, including filtering information.</p>
        <p><strong>Workspace:</strong>Completes challenging tasks with greater abstract thinking for skill sets to understand and apply information. Can connect the dots quicker so generalizations seem to come easier.</p>
        <p><strong>Identifies:</strong>Highly capable or gifted individuals and thrives with mental challenges.</p>
        
       <p>Howard Gardner believed that EQ can be influenced by our cultural, and social environment, but involves multiple intelligences for talents and abilities. He believed EQ was not part of a logical-mathematical intelligence. He defined EQ is your ability to understand other people, what emotions motivates them and how to work cooperatively within a team.
        EQ includes self-awareness, self-regulation, social skills, empathy and motivation, and the ability to connect with people around them.</p>
        <p><strong>Abilities for EQ: </strong>Facilitate thinking, understanding, perceive, control, and evaluation of people’s feelings without judgement.</p>
        <p><strong>Workplace:</strong> Teamwork, leadership, Successful relations, initiative and collaboration with people using EQ for growth in intelligence and personality.</p>
        <p><strong>Identifies:</strong> Leaders, team players, Introverts and extroverts.</p>

        <p>Daniel Goleman’s 1995 book “Emotional Intelligence- Why it can matter more than IQ”. Emotions are managed and facilitate thinking or perceiving emotional meanings when relating with others. In essence qualities can be sharing, thinking about others or putting yourself in their shoes and give someone space to breath.</p>
        <p><emp>Benefits are: Better leadership, performance and a feeling of happiness. Leadership requires collaboration and helping others grow and excel in optimal state of mind.</emp></p>
        During the 1970s, psychologist Paul Eckman identified six basic emotions that he suggested were universally experienced in all human cultures using EQ. 
                    
        <p> Happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise.</p>

        <h3>Happiness</h3>
        
        <p>I was doing an assignment based on the politics within education which I felt extremely comfortable with and had a clear sense of self-confidence. My sense of capability was on a high which involved a high level of EQ to gauge perspectives from others.</p> 
        <p>Confidence never waivered and that inner voice never cropped up, but my internal emotions were continually observed and their effects on others kept in check. Strengths enabled active listening and building a rapport whilst recognising the individual talents allowing people to grow. I tried to identify emotions which supported people to succeed and build empathy to put myself in their shoes, whilst not judging past actions of individuals just notice the present.</p>
        
        Empathy: 
        <ul>
            <li>You are good at really listening to what others have to say.</li>
            <li>People often tell you about their problems.</li>
            <li>You are good at picking up on how other people are feeling.</li>
            <li>You often think about how other people feel.</li>
            <li>Other people come to you for advice.</li>
        </ul>
